Software engineer with over 2 years of experience coding in the Blockchain industry. Currently searching for new challenges (i.e. a job).

Instead of making a flashy professional website I prefer to spend my time learning new things about smart contracts, blockchain, Javascript and coding in general, so this profile README will have to do it for now ðŸ˜‰
